Sample Video Information
========================

This application requires you to upload a video file to test the milestone functionality.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Use any MP4 video file
2. Set a milestone time (e.g., 30 minutes = 1800 seconds)
3. Set a target time (e.g., 13:00)
4. Click "Calculate & Jump to Start Time" to see the calculated start position

The app will calculate when to start the video so that the milestone occurs at your target time using:
Start Time = Milestone Time - (Target Time - Current Time)

Example:
- Current time: 12:30
- Target time: 13:00
- Milestone at: 30 minutes into video
- Delta time: 30 minutes (13:00 - 12:30)
- Start time: 0 minutes (30 min milestone - 30 min delta = 0)
